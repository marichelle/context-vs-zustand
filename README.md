# context-vs-zustand

- If your application has a simple global state and you prefer using built-in React features, React Context API might be the better option.
- If your application has complex state updates, async actions, or requires better performance optimizations, Zustand is the better option.
- Zustand is designed to be minimalistic and easy to use, making it suitable for small to medium-sized applications.
- Redux, by comparison, is a more robust state management solution with a larger ecosystem and more advanced features.
